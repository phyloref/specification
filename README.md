# The Phyloreferencing specification

The goal of the phyloreferencing specification is to describe what 
phyloreferences are and how they can be represented as information
artifacts.

The specification is currently an early draft and is [available online in Markdown](specification.md).
Please suggest improvements or point out errors in the specification through
[the issue tracker](https://github.com/phyloref/specification/issues).

We are also working on additional documents that provide information on:

 - [Implementing phyloreferences in OWL 2](drafts/phyloreferences_in_owl.md)
 - [How phyloreferences relate to phylogenetic clade definitions](drafts/phylogenetic_clade_definitions.md)

These documents are currently early drafts, and content from them may
eventually be merged into the main specification rather than maintaining
them as separate documents.
